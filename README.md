# simple-Landing-page
I have created a simple responsive landing page by using HTML and CSS .
After runing the code the images of the page may not load because of some issue in the cloudfront.net website.
So you can change the img url and add your inages to the web page.
Tools used are :- Bootstrap , cloudfront , and fontawsome.
